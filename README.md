# -Register-File-Design-with-32x8-bit-Word-SRAM-Memory-Array

•Designed a Register File (RF) implementing an 8-bit word size comprising 32 words, employing a 5-bit address for precise read and write operations.
•Developed individual components, including a 6T SRAM cell, 8-bit Word, 32 8-bit words, 5-input NAND gate, Inverter, and Row Decoder, ensuring meticulous layout design and error-free implementation.
•Implemented Design Rule Check (DRC) and Layout vs. Schematic (LVS) checks on each component's layout and extracted view to guarantee compliance and accurate net-list matching.
